# Understanding AgnosticUI

AgnosticUI is a set of UI primitives that start their lives in clean HTML and CSS. These standards compliant components are then copied to our framework implementations in: React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.

## Approach

### Decoupled CSS

AgnosticUI is not tied to a particular JavaScript framework, because our build process complies and even enforces the &ldquo;1 stylesheetâ€¦many frameworks&rdquo; approach which works as follows:

<div class="mbe24"></div>

Our first step to building a component (like a Button) starts in the `agnostic-css` package. Generally, this results in a `component.html` file, and a `component.css` file. For example, `button.html` and `button.css`.

<div class="mbe24"></div>

When we're ready to create a corresponding component (e.g. a React button), we utilize a simple [NodeJS script](https://nodejs.org/en/) that literally copies the `component.css` (e.g. `button.css`) into the framework's component directory and import it directly.

<div class="mbe16"></div>

_For Svelte and Vue's [SFC](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/single-file-component.html) we instead replace the contents within the `<style></style>` tags._

<div class="mbe24"></div>

The above approach forces our framework-specific implementations to use the same single stylesheet. Ultimately, this means you can make [theme customizations](https://agnosticui.com/docs/theming.html#example-of-theming-with-css-custom-properties) once, then use these CSS custom property overrides across your React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte based applicationsâ€¦and they will have a consistent look and feel!

<div class="mbe24"></div>

_If you're curious, there's an article on [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) â€” [How to Make a Component That Supports Multiple Frameworks in a Monorepo](https://css-tricks.com/make-a-component-multiple-frameworks-in-a-monorepo/)~~ â€” that describes how much of this gets set up in painstaking details. Note AgnosticUI no longer uses `yarn workspaces` or hoisted dependencies, but otherwise, the article explains the same setup._

### Frameworks

AgnosticUI has 5 packages.

<div class="mbe24"></div>

The `agnostic-css` package is where all component HTML and CSS starts. All styles derive from this package as described earlier.

<div class="mbe24"></div>

The framework-specific implementations available are: `agnostic-react`, `agnostic-vue`, `agnostic-angular`, and `agnostic-svelte`.

<div class="mbe24"></div>

### Primitives

Think of the components AgnosticUI provides as _primitive_ or _presentational components_ that you can build atop. We purposely avoid overly complex components like the [Data Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/grid/dataGrids.html) in efforts to keep AgnosticUI's core as minimal and maintainable as possible.

<div class="mbe24"></div>

 _We may consider a community-driven `addons` repository in the future for more complex components that don't belong in core if there's support from the community._

### Clean CSS

Broadly-speaking, AgnosticUI's CSS follows [Jonathan Snook's](https://snook.ca/) [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) and [Nicole Sullivan's](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/) [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/tree/master/oocss#overview). [Mark Otto](https://markdotto.com/about/) describes a similar approach in his article on using [chained classes](https://markdotto.com/2012/02/16/scope-css-classes-with-prefixes/).

<div class="mbe24"></div>

_We don't generally follow the state rules in SMACSS like `is-STATE` e.g. we'll generally favor using native `[disabled]` over creating an extra class `.is-disabled` since it's likely that we've needed to interact with the native `[disabled]` from JavaScript anyway. There's an exception: if we've disabled an anchor tag by adding the `[disabled]` attribute, but we want to further add a class on its parent wrapper, that class on the parent may in fact use `is-disabled`. To add to the confusion, our JavaScript framework props do in fact use `isState` props to allow consumers to specify the state of a component._ ðŸ˜Ž

### No Preprocessing

While preprocessors certainly supply an enjoyable developer experience, AgnosticUI favors the use of standards-based raw CSS. This means structures like loops, maps, and lists, are not available. Essentially, these sorts of structures need to be _unrolled_, and thus the code is a bit more verbose. But, the benefit of coding directly on the platform and moving towards upcoming web standards seems worth it. Of course, we do use `autoprefixer` to help out with any vendor prefix shenanigans.

<div class="mbe24"></div>

### Components + Tokens + Utilities

AgnosticUI mostly consists of UI components and the CSS custom properties mentioned in the Theming section. However, for convenience we've included some minimal [CSS Utilities](https://css-tricks.com/need-css-utility-library/) in [common](https://github.com/AgnosticUI/agnosticui/tree/master/agnostic-css/public/css-src). These are mostly for rapid layout development using [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox), [margin/padding via logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties). At time of writing, AgnosticUI adds these with some trepidation as we don't want to increase the build size. If you're looking for a full-blown utility-first library you should probably look at TailWind or similar.

<div class="mbe24"></div>

The [utilities page](./utilities.md) shows the available CSS utilities as does the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/AgnosticUI/agnosticui/blob/master/agnostic-css/public/css-dist/common.concat.css#L276).

## Benefits

As AgnosticUI works across many frameworksâ€”one stylesheetâ€¦many frameworksâ€”your design system team will be able to generate a &ldquo;single source of truth&rdquo;. This theme will manifest as a single [CSS custom properties theme](https://agnosticui.com/docs/theming.html) that can be imported across your various projects.

<div class="mbe24"></div>

For example, let's imagine your company's flagship product is coded in React, an administraction site is coded in Vue 3, and a back-office application is coded in Angular. All of these would share the same [CSS custom properties theme](https://agnosticui.com/docs/theming.html), and would therefore have a consistent look and feel.

<div class="mbe24"></div>

Then, your front-end developer &ldquo;rock star&rdquo; decides she wants to use Svelte on that _hackathon project_. Well, she can simply drop in the [custom properties theme](https://agnosticui.com/docs/theming.html) and get right to hacking up her Svelte idea.

<div class="mbe24"></div>

_We don't recommend the use of 2+ frameworks in an application with a single HTTP payload due to the increased bundle size that will be sent down to your users. However, completely separate applications are fair game for using different front-end frameworks; especially for polyglot teams that long to use new technologies, or letting an outsourced team use the technology they're most proficient in._

## Roadmap 

As AgnosticUI is still very much in its infancy, we advise you to hold off using it for mission critical production applications. That said, things **are** moving along quite nicely with a current focus on increasing the overall component coverage provided. We invite you to view the upcoming components planned for development on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/AgnosticUI/agnosticui/issues). Also, feel free to participate in our [discussions](https://github.com/AgnosticUI/agnosticui/discussions) or help us out by [contributing to AgnosticUI](https://github.com/AgnosticUI/agnosticui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Angular

::: danger
The Angular package is highly experimental!
:::

The Angular package should especially be considered experimental as we're not using the library for any production applications. We've elected to challenge ourselves to create comparable component implementations, but you should probably assume there will be bugs that you may need to contribute your own pull request patches for if you elect to use it for your projects. You've been warned `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`
