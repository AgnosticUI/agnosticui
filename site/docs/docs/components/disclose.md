    <h3>Disclose with background</h3>
    <p class="mbs16 mbe24">The earlier example favors using

      may be use cases that that require a stronger visual affordance
      for the disclose elements themeselves. If that's the case, you
      can utilize the <code>isBackground</code> prop which achieves
      the following:
    </p>
    <Disclose
      isBackground
      title="Roger Federer"
    >
      Roger Federer is a Swiss professional tennis player.

In your Angular configuration (likely `angular.json`) ensure you're including
the common AgnosticUI styles:

<div class="mbe16"></div>

` "styles": ["agnostic-angular/common.min.css"],`

<div class="mbe24"></div>

Add AgnosticUI's `AgModule` module:

```js{3,9}
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AgModule } from 'agnostic-angular';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, AgModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now you can use in your components:

```js
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'your-component',
  template: `
  <div class="mbe48">
