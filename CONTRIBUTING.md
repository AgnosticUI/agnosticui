## Contributing

AgnosticUI v2 is stabilizing. The best way to contribute right now is to use it and report what works and what doesn't — issues and feedback are genuinely valuable at this stage.

If you're comfortable poking around `package.json` scripts, the project structure is approachable: core library in `/v2/lib/`, CLI in `/v2/cli/`, docs in `/v2/site/`, and per-framework Storybook playgrounds in `/v2/playgrounds/`. You're welcome to explore and open a PR — just know that formal contribution docs are still being written.
