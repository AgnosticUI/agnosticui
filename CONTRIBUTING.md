## Contributions on Hold

AgnosticUI v1 is being retired in favor of AgnosticUI Local (v2), which is a full rewrite rather than a direct continuation of v1.

v2 is built on Lit web components with React and Vue wrappers, and shifts to a CLI-based model that copies components directly into your project—giving you full ownership and flexibility without dependency lock-in.

Because of this architectural change, things are quite unstable with several moving parts. That said, I believe we are very close to landing an alpha release soon. Once that happens, I will definitely prioritize coming back here and updating contribution process as we definitely would welcome help!
