# Contributing to AgnosticUI

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We're genuinely excited to have people who want to help make AgnosticUI better.

## Current Status: Almost There

AgnosticUI v2 is a complete architectural rewrite from v1. We've moved from distributed framework wrappers to a local-first model where components are generated directly into your project as editable source code. It's built on Lit web components with React, Vue, and Svelte support.

**The good news:** We're very close to being ready for outside contributions. The core architecture is solid, the component library is comprehensive, and the documentation site is looking sharp.

**The reality:** We're still stabilizing a few moving parts and want to make sure the contribution experience is smooth before we throw the doors wide open. We're talking weeks, not months.

## What's Coming

Once we're ready, we'll be looking for help with:

- **Component improvements** – Better accessibility, additional variants, bug fixes
- **Framework adapters** – Helping maintain React, Vue, Svelte, and other wrappers
- **Documentation** – Examples, guides, better explanations
- **Developer experience** – CLI improvements, better error messages, tooling
- **Real-world testing** – Using AgnosticUI in production and reporting what works (and what doesn't)

**We're particularly interested in hearing from:**
- **Accessibility experts** – Help us ensure WCAG compliance and real-world usability for people with disabilities
- **Framework maintainers** – Deep expertise in React, Vue, Svelte, or other framework internals

## In the Meantime

If you're eager to contribute now:

1. **Try it out** – The best way to help is to actually use AgnosticUI and report issues
2. **Report bugs** – Open issues with clear reproduction steps
3. **Suggest improvements** – Tell us what's confusing, what's missing, or what could be better
4. **Share your use case** – Let us know how you're using (or want to use) AgnosticUI

We'll absolutely prioritize issues and feature requests from people actively trying to use the library.

## Stay in Touch

Watch the repo for updates, and we'll announce when we're ready for contributions. If you have specific ideas or want to discuss something, open an issue—we're friendly and responsive.

Thanks for your patience and enthusiasm. We're building something good here, and we'd love your help making it great.
