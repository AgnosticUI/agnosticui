# AgnosticUI v2 - LLM Context Guide

## Project Overview
AgnosticUI Local (v2) is a CLI-based UI component library that copies Lit web components directly into your project. Developers own the code, can customize it freely, and avoid dependency lock-in.

## Key Architecture
- **Framework**: Built with Lit for web components
- **Approach**: CLI-first tool that copies components to your project
- **Language**: Primarily TypeScript (86.8%)
- **Structure**: Core components are located in `/v2/lib/src/components/`
- **React/Vue Wrappers**: Core components are wrapped in React and Vue wrappers for native framework experience (props instead of attributes, proper event handling, full TypeScript support). Located in `/v2/lib/src/components/[COMPONENT]/{react|vue}/` and use barrel files to export their API/interface.

## CLI Usage
The main entry point is `npx agnosticui-cli` (or `npx ag` if installed locally) which copies components directly into target projects. Run `npx agnosticui-cli --help` for available commands. The CLI is in `/v2/cli`.

## Component Structure
Each core component is in the `/v2/lib/` - `/v2/lib/src/components/[component-name]/` and contains:
1. Lit web component implementation (.ts)
2. Styles (.css)
3. Tests
4. Documentation (to be added)
5. React and Vue wrappers
6. Barrel files are used for both core and react/vue wrappers.

## Theme System
The project uses a systematic design token approach via Style Dictionary located in `/v2/theme-registry/`:
- **52 production-ready tokens**: colors, spacing, border-radius, surfaces, borders, focus, motion, z-index
- **Prefix**: All CSS variables use `--ag-` prefix (e.g., `--ag-primary`, `--ag-focus`)
- **Output formats**: CSS custom properties, JavaScript exports, JSON
- **Themes**: Light and dark theme variants with automatic token switching via `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element (e.g., `[data-theme="dark"]`)
- **White-labeling**: Enterprise-ready theming capabilities
- **Build**: Run `npm run build` in theme-registry to regenerate tokens
- See `/v2/theme-registry/README.md` for complete token documentation

## Project Structure

### Core Library (`/v2/lib/`)
- Component implementations, tests, and framework wrappers
- Dependencies: Lit, TypeScript, @floating-ui/dom, @lit/react, focus-trap
- Check `/v2/lib/package.json` for exact versions

### CLI Tool (`/v2/cli/`)
- Main entry point: `npx agnosticui-cli` command (or `npx ag` if installed locally)
- Copies components directly into target projects
- Run `npx agnosticui-cli --help` for available commands (see `/v2/site/docs/installation.md` for details)

### Documentation (`/v2/site/`)
- Built with Vitepress
- Contains all user-facing documentation and guides
- Component API documentation and usage examples

### Development Playgrounds (`/v2/playgrounds/`)
- Storybooks for React, Lit, and Vue
- Used for local development and spot checks only
- Not for production; for component isolation and testing

### Test Examples (`/v2/examples/`)
- `/v2/examples/lit-test/` - Lit consumption test artifacts
- `/v2/examples/react-test/` - React consumption test artifacts
- `/v2/examples/vue-test/` - Vue consumption test artifacts
- Manual testing artifacts from CLI-based component consumption
- Real-world integration validation

## Development Setup
- Node.js environment required
- Main dependencies: Lit, TypeScript
- Secondary dependencies for v2/lib are:
  "dependencies": {
    "@floating-ui/dom": "^1.7.4",
    "@lit/react": "^1.0.8", <-- only needed for React
    "focus-trap": "^7.6.5"
  },
- Check `/v2/package.json` for exact versions
