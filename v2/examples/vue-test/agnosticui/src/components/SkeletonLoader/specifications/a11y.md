Color contrast

Graphics and user interface components like skeleton loading shapes can have a lower contrast ratio because of their large size and surrounding white space.

The skeleton is not focusable via keyboard.

Screen readers

Wrap the entire skeleton in a container.
Add role="status" and aria-live="polite" to this container. This announces the beginning of the loading event.
Add aria-busy="true" to this container. This tells the screen reader to ignore the placeholder "bones" inside and wait for the actual content.
Ensure all visual "bones" inside the container are marked with aria-hidden="true" so they aren't accidentally read aloud as gibberish.
When the real content arrives, replace the skeleton, remove role="status", and update aria-busy to "false".

Motion

As per the WCAG guidelines, it is recommended to permit users to disable superfluous animation, as certain users may become unfocused or encounter adverse effects like vertigo or queasiness from animated material. This can be achieved by ensuring that any animation ceases after five seconds, and non-essential motion such as loading dots can be turned off by users.

Prefers reduced motion
The shimmer animation should be disabled when enabling the prefers-reduced-motion setting at the OS level.
