    "Something caught me off guard last autumn while reading a novel I had been putting off for months. Midway through the second chapter, I noticed I was still on the same page — not because the prose was difficult, but because I had forgotten how to stay. I would reach a paragraph's end and find myself scanning back, unsure what I had just absorbed. The words were there, but I wasn't.",
    'We are, by nearly every measure, reading more than at any point in human history: emails, articles, threads, newsletters, reports. Text floods through our days in a continuous current. And yet a growing number of people report feeling less able to engage with extended written thought than they once did. We read more and comprehend less. We consume faster and retain barely anything.',
    'The neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf has spent decades studying what happens in the brain during reading. She describes the human capacity for deep reading — the slow, immersive kind — as a magnificent but fragile achievement. Unlike spoken language, which is biologically hardwired, reading is a cultural technology the brain must learn, and can partially unlearn. The habits encouraged by digital interfaces — scanning, jumping, multitasking — are, she argues, rewiring our reading circuits in real time.',
    'This is not an argument against the internet, which has done extraordinary things for access to knowledge and expression. It is an argument about design. Most digital environments are built to keep attention moving: another headline, another notification, another recommendation. Depth requires the opposite — the willingness to stay somewhere long enough for meaning to accumulate. The architecture of our devices systematically discourages that kind of staying.',
    'Deep reading, as Wolf defines it, is not simply understanding what words mean. It is the cognitive and emotional process by which we make connections, generate inferences, feel the weight of a sentence, and inhabit another point of view. It is how empathy is practised at scale. It is how complex argument becomes something more than information — something that changes how we think. Strip that capacity away and we are left with faster processing of less.',
    "Reclaiming depth does not require a wholesale rejection of screens. It requires deliberate design of one's reading life. That might mean reserving certain texts for paper. It might mean using a browser extension that removes sidebars and notifications. It might mean reading with a pencil — not to annotate cleverly, but to slow the eye down. It might simply mean deciding, before opening an article, that you are going to finish it.",
    'Re-reading is one of the most underrated strategies of all. In digital culture we almost never return to something we have already read; there is always more to consume. But returning to a difficult passage, a resonant sentence, a paragraph that confused you the first time, does something that novelty cannot: it lets the text work on you rather than the other way around.',
    'The screen you are reading these words on is not your enemy. Screens are neutral surfaces. What surrounds them — the alerts, the tabs, the ambient pressure to be elsewhere — that is what makes depth hard. Build a reading environment that strips those pressures away, even briefly, and the same words can do what they always could: slow time, open thought, and briefly make the interior life feel large.',
