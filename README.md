# Agnostic UI

## TODO LIST

### Completed
- [x] Svelte script that copies over the <style>...</style> from top-level button.css

### On Deck
- [ ] Adds storybook for each type e.g. react, vue, svelte, etc., all have their own storybook envs
- [ ] React CSS Modules that `composes` from top-level button.css
- [ ] See if we can pull it into Pelotrack
- [ ] Vue CSS Modules that `composes` from top-level button.css (or should we do same as Svelte?)
- [ ] Sizes, block, icon left/right variants, raised

## After we have POC buttons
- [ ] Design the Agnostic portal site 
- [ ] Write a rationale doc and start recruiting
- [ ] Implement some of the portal to showcase the idea
- [ ] Transition into more of a tech lead role in the project (goal: have a couple core contributors that understand the project goals by this point)
