# AgnosticUI Local

AgnosticUI Local (v2) is a CLI-based UI component library that copies components directly into your project. You own the code, customize it freely, and avoid dependency lock-in.

## Update

AgnosticUI v2 is a complete rewrite with a fundamentally different approach — from being rewritten in Lit web components to taking a CLI-first based approach. The rewrite is well underway and being done in the `/v2` directory. README.md updates to follow once completed.

### Where is v1?

AgnosticUI v2 is a complete rewrite and is not compatible with v1. If you need v1, it remains available via `git tag`'s:
- Packages: `agnostic-angular`, `agnostic-react`, `agnostic-vue`, `agnostic-svelte`, etc.
- Tag: `v1-legacy`
