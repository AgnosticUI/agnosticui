# AgnosticUI


[AgnosticUI Documentation](https://agnosticui.github.io/agnosticui)

AgnosticUI is a set of UI primitives that start their lives in clean HTML and CSS. These standards compliant components are then copied to our framework implementations in: React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.

## Features

- Not tied to a particular JavaScript framework
- Available in React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte
- [Vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/) works too!! ðŸ˜Ž
- CSS custom properties-based theming
- Clean, semantic, and accessible HTML
- Decoupled standards-based CSS (no preprocessing)
