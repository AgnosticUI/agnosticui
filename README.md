# Agnostic UI

## TODOs

1. Svelte script that copies over the <style>...</style> from top-level button.css
1. Adds storybook for each type e.g. react, vue, svelte, etc., all have their own storybook envs
1. React CSS Modules that `composes` from top-level button.css
1. See if we can pull it into Pelotrack
1. Vue CSS Modules that `composes` from top-level button.css (or should we do same as Svelte?)
1. Sizes, block, icon left/right variants, raised

## After we have POC buttons
1. Design the Agnostic portal site 
1. Write a rationale doc and start recruiting
1. Implement some of the portal to showcase the idea
1. Transition into more of a tech lead role in the project (goal: have a couple core contributors that understand the project goals by this point)
