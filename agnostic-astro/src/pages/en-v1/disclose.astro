      <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/" target="_blank">Astro components</a>. These build-time components will help
      your project get closer to realizing a mostly <span class="quoted">no client-side runtime</span>â€¦if you do it right, this should mean an all-green 100% Lighthouse performance score!
      Leverage the benefits of <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/partial-hydration/#island-architecture" target="_blank">Islands architecture</a>
      by sending mostly server built <a href="https://github.com/agnosticui/agnosticui/agnostic-astro" target="_blank">agnostic-astro</a> components. Then,
      sprinkle client-hydrated ones only as needed.</p>

      <div class="h4 mbe24">Usage</div>
      <p class="mbe12">Ensure you've installed and setup the <a href="https://github.com/AgnosticUI/agnosticui/tree/master/integrations/astro/agnostic-astro" target="_blank">AgnosticUI Astro integration</a>
      which will import the required <code>common.min.css</code> onto your page:
      <Code code={`npm i @astro/agnostic-astro`} lang="bash" wrap />
      </p>
      <p class="mbs24 mbe12">Then add the integration to your <code>astro.config.mjs</code>: 
        <Code code={`import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import agnosticAstro from '@astrojs/agnostic-astro';
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [agnosticAstro()]
});`} lang="javascript" wrap />
      </p>
      <p class="mbs24 mbe12">Then you can import Astro Disclose component:
      <Code code={`import AgDisclose from 'agnostic-astro/Disclose.astro';`} lang="javascript" wrap />
      </p>
      <p class="mbs24 mbe12">Here's the <a href="https://github.com/AgnosticUI/agnosticui/tree/master/agnostic-astro" target="_blank">agnostic-astro</a> Disclose component in use:</p>
