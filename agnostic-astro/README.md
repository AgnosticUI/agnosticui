**agnostic-astro** is the Astro port of AgnosticUI that leverages [XElement](https://xelement-docs.vercel.app/) and [Astro components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/). These UI components take advantage of the Astro's unique _HTML-only templating with no client-side runtime_ capabilities.

The fact that Astro components render to HTML during your build means a boost in performance and a faster site for your users‚Ä¶and this is exactly why we eagerly created a port of our UI components for our fellow Astro devs!

### What is AgnosticUI?

AgnosticUI is a set of UI primitives that start their lives in clean HTML and CSS. These standards compliant components are then copied to our framework implementations in: Astro (new), React, Vue 3, Svelte, and Angular (experimental).
