# Code of Conduct

## The Spirit

AgnosticUI is built on the idea that good UI components should be accessible, transparent, and genuinely helpful. That same philosophy extends to our community—we're here to build something useful together, not to gatekeep or create drama.

## What We're About

**Be kind.** Assume good intent. Help people level up. We all started somewhere, and nobody has all the answers.

**Be constructive.** Disagreements happen—that's how we improve things. Critique ideas, not people. If you're pointing out a problem, bonus points for suggesting a solution.

**Be inclusive.** Different perspectives make better software. We welcome people regardless of experience level, background, identity, or which framework they prefer (yes, even if it's not the one you like).

**Be respectful.** Don't be a jerk. If someone asks you to stop doing something that's bothering them, stop. It's that simple.

## What We're Not About

- Harassment, threats, or personal attacks
- Discrimination based on identity, experience level, or technical choices
- Sharing someone's private info without permission
- Trolling, derailing, or intentionally making spaces unwelcoming
- Being creepy or making people uncomfortable

## If Something's Wrong

If someone's behavior is making the community worse, let us know. Reach out to **roblevinillustration@gmail.com** and we'll handle it. We'll keep it confidential and take it seriously.

We're not going to hand-wring over every minor disagreement, but we will act on patterns of behavior that make people feel unwelcome.

## The Practical Bit

This applies to GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, and anywhere else you're representing the project. If you're wearing the AgnosticUI hat in public, keep it professional.

Maintainers can remove comments, reject contributions, or ban people who are making the community worse. We'll try to be fair and communicate clearly, but ultimately we're here to build something useful—not to referee endless drama.
