Let&#39;s talk about the project&#39;s features and structure.</p><h2 id="approach" tabindex="-1">Approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#approach" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h3 id="decoupled-css" tabindex="-1">Decoupled CSS <a class="header-anchor" href="#decoupled-css" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>AgnosticUI is not tied to a particular JavaScript framework, because our build process complies and even enforces the \u201C1 stylesheet\u2026many frameworks\u201D approach.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>First we build a component (like a Button) in the <code>agnostic-css</code> package. Generally, this results in component <code>html</code> and <code>css</code> files respectively. For example, <code>button.html</code>, and <code>button.css</code>.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>When we venture to create a corresponding component (e.g. a React button), we set up a simply <code>copystyles.js</code> NodeJS script to literally copy the <code>button.css</code> styles into the framework&#39;s component directory and import it directly.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>Once copied, we&#39;re careful not to add any custom CSS to the component. This forces our framework-specific implementation to be consistent with others that use the same 1 stylesheet approach.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>If you&#39;re curious, there&#39;s an article (coming very soon!) <s>on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">css-tricks</a> \u2014 <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Little Button That Could</a></s> \u2014 that describes exactly how this all gets set up in painstaking details.</p><h3 id="frameworks" tabindex="-1">Frameworks <a class="header-anchor" href="#frameworks" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>AgnosticUI has 5 packages.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>The <code>agnostic-css</code> package is where all component HTML and CSS starts. All styles derive from this package as described above.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>The other packages are the framework-specific component implementations: <code>agnostic-react</code>, <code>agnostic-vue</code>, <code>agnostic-angular</code>, and <code>agnostic-svelte</code>. These components preserve a11y compliant HTML.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><h4 id="primitives" tabindex="-1">Primitives <a class="header-anchor" href="#primitives" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>AgnosticUI&#39;s components are <em>primitives</em> in that they expose only the minimal needed functionality required. For accessibility compliance, this sometimes does mean some fairly involved <em>keyboard navigation</em> code; but otherwise, JavaScript minimized where possible.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>It&#39;s probably most useful to think of the components AgnosticUI provide as <em>primitive components</em>, or <em>presentation components</em>. So, if you need an ultra-sophisticated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/grid/dataGrids.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Grid</a> it will likely never be in AgnosticUI core. Perhaps, we&#39;ll consider an <em>addons</em> repository in the future, but for now, this is our approach.</p><h3 id="clean-css" tabindex="-1">Clean CSS <a class="header-anchor" href="#clean-css" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>AgnosticUI&#39;s CSS loosely follows <a href="https://snook.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Snook&#39;s</a> <a href="http://smacss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SMACSS</a> and <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Sullivan&#39;s</a> <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/tree/master/oocss#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OOCSS</a>. <a href="https://markdotto.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Otto&#39;s</a> notion of <a href="https://markdotto.com/2012/02/16/scope-css-classes-with-prefixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chained classes</a> seems applicable as well and if you&#39;ve spent a lot of time in the <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/main/scss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap SCSS</a> code, AgnosticUI&#39;s should be quite approachable to you.</p><h4 id="no-preprocessing" tabindex="-1">No preprocessing <a class="header-anchor" href="#no-preprocessing" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>As long-time Sass enthusiasts, we at some point elected to unroll all Sass loops and maps in favor of standards-based CSS (at times leveraging <a href="https://postcss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostCSS</a> to smooth the transition; AgnosticUI just uses CSS so even PostCSS is not needed).</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>The reason is similar to how the community embraced ES6 and platform-based JavaScript over <a href="https://coffeescript.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffeescript</a> (which itself deserves credit for pushing web standards in its time) years ago\u2014the idea is to \u201Ccode towards the platform\u201D where possible. As such, you&#39;ll see <code>.css</code> files used in AgnosticUI&#39;s codebase.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><h3 id="components-tokens-utilities" tabindex="-1">Components + Tokens + Utilities <a class="header-anchor" href="#components-tokens-utilities" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>AgnosticUI mostly consists of UI components and the CSS custom properties mentioned in the Theming section. However, for convenience we&#39;ve included some minimal <a href="https://css-tricks.com/need-css-utility-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Utilities</a> in <a href="https://github.com/AgnosticUI/agnosticui/tree/master/agnostic-css/public/css-src" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">common</a>. These are mostly for rapid layout development using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flexbox</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">margin/padding via logical properties</a>. At time of writing, AgnosticUI adds these with some trepidation as we don&#39;t want to increase the build size. If you&#39;re looking for a full-blown utility-first library you should probably look at TailWind or similar.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>The <a href="./utilities.html">utilities page</a> shows the available CSS utilities as does the <a href="https://github.com/AgnosticUI/agnosticui/blob/master/agnostic-css/public/css-dist/common.concat.css#L276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="how-does-1-stylesheet\u2026many-frameworks-benefit-me" tabindex="-1">How does 1 stylesheet\u2026many frameworks benefit me? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-1-stylesheet\u2026many-frameworks-benefit-me" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>As AgnosticUI works across many frameworks\u2014one stylesheet\u2026many frameworks\u2014your design team will be able to be directly involved in the generating of a \u201Csingle source of truth\u201D CSS custom properties theme. This theme setup can then be used and imported across your various projects regardless of the framework used.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>For example, you could have your company&#39;s flagship product coded in React, an administraction site coded in Vue 3, and a back-office application coded in Angular. All of these would share the same CSS custom properties values, and thus have the same branded theme.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>Then your FE rock-star decides she now loves Svelte\u2014well, she can build a product in Svelte.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p><em>Note that while we love the microfrontend approach in general, we do not specifically recommend that you share 2+ frameworks in a single application (or any shared http payload) for obvious performance implications passed down to your users. But, separate apps are totally fair game for using a different framework!</em></p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>This flexibility is helpful for many reasons. Say you have a team that you&#39;d like to outsource an upcoming back-office application to, and they happen to have 3x proficiency in Angular over React. It would be silly to force them to use an uncomfortable framework and slow them down. But if your design system was tied to React\u2014you would have to. With AgnosticUI, just use the same theming tokens and the Angular back-office app will reflect the same branding design choices made for your React-based flagship app.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>It&#39;s also, of course, fun for \u201Cpolyglot developers\u201D who want to experiment with new technology stacks without straying from already established brand guidelines.</p>',47),i=[r];function n(c,l,d,p,h,m){return o(),t("div",null,i)}var g=e(s,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
