    <p class="card-demo-desc mbe24">Note that the AgnosticUI Card component is a very thin layer and only supplies the card as a shell for you to project your own content (and thus HTML and CSS) onto. For example, this card is essentially a row-based horizontal layout as the image is on the left and the body of the card (where you&#x27;re reading now!) is on the right. But that aspect of this layout is demo code. Some things are offered by the card component though — if the viewport narrows enough, for example, it becomes a stacked card. If you want the card always be stacked, see the example below which applies the appropriate stacked card class.</p>
