    This content was once hidden before you were so fortunate to witness the great reveal. <span> The <a
         href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reveal_(narrative)">reveal</a> </span>
    (also known as the big reveal) is a plot device in narrative structure, and is the exposure to the reader or
    audience of a previously unseen key character or element of plot or of the performance. In web development, we like
    to call this <span> <a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/progressive-disclosure">progressive
        disclosure</a> because </span> we initially hide secondary content, but then progressively disclose (or reveal)
    it.
