title: Table
notes: |
  Tables default to an implied "medium" size.
  Other sizes available are small, large, jumbo (by using class table-SIZE e.g. table-large).
  Also available areâ€”table-striped, table-hoverable, table-borderless.
  
  Responsive tables basically just enable horizontal scrolling when the table is too wide to fit.
  
  To base responsiveness off of the natural width of your table, just wrap the table in a container element with class table-responsive.
  
  Otherwise, you can control the breakpoint at which the scrolling would revert to the table default of no scrolling by setting a breakpoint-based class
  like table-responsive-SIZE (where size is one of small, medium, large, or xlarge; e.g. table-responsive-small would provide horizontal scrolling, if needed, up to the 576px but not above that size).

  Tables can be stacked with table-stacked. When doing so, you will want to supply data-label attributes for your cells.
