notes: The <i>aria-disabled="true"</i> and <i>tabindex="-1"</i> should be added to previous link if you're on the very first page, or to the next link if you're on the very last page. The parent disabled <i>LI</i> element should be given the class <i>is-disabled</i>. The current page should be given the attribute <i>aria-current="page"</i> attribute. Within the anchor tag we visually hidden using the <i>screenreader-only</i> class to provide more descriptive wording. This is done so that the raw numbers aren't announced by a screenreader in isolation with no context.
