  description: Note that the AgnosticUI Card component is a very thin layer and only supplies the card as a shell for you to project your own content (and thus HTML and CSS) onto. For example, this card is essentially a row-based horizontal layout as the image is on the left and the body of the card (where you're reading now!) is on the right. But that aspect of this layout is demo code. Some things are offered by the card component though â€” if the viewport narrows enough, for example, it becomes a stacked card. If you want the card always be stacked, see the example below which applies the appropriate stacked card class.
