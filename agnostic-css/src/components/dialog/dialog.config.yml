title: Dialog
notes: |
  Dialog is a base-level implementation of a dialog component that can/will be leveraged for other components like popover, modal, menu, etc. Currently, the demo here is utilizing Kitty Giraudel's [a11y-dialog](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/a11y-dialog) which is a very clean styling-agnostic JavaScript implementation that supports what you'd expect from an a11y-compliant dialog and has saved me a lot of time while I figure out the styles. Thus, the structure should be consistent with what `a11y-dialog` recommends in terms of markup structure. The `a11y-dialog` script is currently pulled in via CDN.

  To be absolutely 100% clear, if you utilize AgnosticUI's CSS package, you only get the HTML/CSS for dialog. The functionality in terms of showing / dismissing the dialog, navigating with your keyboard, etc., is being handled by [a11y-dialog](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/a11y-dialog). The AgnosticUI framework implementations (React, Angular, Svelte, Vue, etc.) likely WILL handle said functionality once they've been implemented (not the case at time of writing).
