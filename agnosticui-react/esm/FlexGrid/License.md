Here's a link to the original author's GitHub for this software:

Note that we looked for a License file in the react-flexbox-grid GitHub repository, but there was none that we could find but it was clearly listed as MIT in the README.md and package.json. Given that, I've added the MIT License above explicitly crediting the original author, Roy Lee.
